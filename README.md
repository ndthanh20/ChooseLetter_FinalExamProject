# CHOOSE LETTER - THE FINAL EXAM PROJECT OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
This is the final exam project of Software Engineering. The project uses Phaser game framework to implement.

## About the game
A project built by Phaser and TypeScript. The purpose of the project is to help children become familiar with and master the alphabet through extremely beautiful and fun word guessing screens. Each screen will have three animals with the corresponding three letters and children will hear instructions to choose the appropriate letter.
## Phaser 3
Phaser is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework that offers WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and native apps by using 3rd party tools. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for development.

Along with the fantastic open source community, Phaser is actively developed and maintained by Photon Storm. As a result of rapid support, and a developer friendly API, Phaser is currently one of the most starred game frameworks on GitHub.

The Phaser version that I have used is 3.23.0.
### Install Phaser via npm: 
```bash
npm install phaser
```

## TypeScript
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

### Install TypeScript via npm:
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
To use Phaser and TypeScript together, you need to add "phaser.js" to your tsconfig.json file
